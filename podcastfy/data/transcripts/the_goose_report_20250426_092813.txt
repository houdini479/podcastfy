<Person1>Welcome to The Goose Report - One honk a day keeps the chaos away.. Today, we’re diving deep into some serious AI-powered coding wizardry!    We're talking task-driven development, memory banks, and...Firecore?!
</Person1><Person2>Sounds intense!  Uh, fill me in. What’s Firecore?
</Person2><Person1>It's this awesome open-source tool for feeding your AI clean website data.  Think scraping, but smarter.
</Person1><Person2>Oh, like for TripFix?  Getting all that airline data squeaky clean?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly!  It handles PDFs, Excel, even tricky websites. They’ve got a new agent that can navigate a whole domain, even log in!
</Person1><Person2>Woah, that’s huge!  Imagine the possibilities for, um, competitive analysis!
</Person2><Person1>Right? Okay, but back to coding.   Task-driven development.  Have you heard of it?
</Person1><Person2>Uh, vaguely. Isn’t that like, writing tests before you code?
</Person2><Person1>Bingo!  You define input, expected output, and let the AI iterate until all tests pass.  No more endless error fixing!
</Person1><Person2>I see, interesting, got it. So, less debugging, more building?
</Person2><Person1>Way more building!  It's a game changer for complex functions.
</Person1><Person2>And what about this “memory bank” thing?  Sounds kinda sci-fi.
</Person2><Person1>It’s like giving your AI a project history.  It keeps track of tech stack, decisions, progress...everything! So it doesn't break your existing code when adding new features.
</Person1><Person2>That’s…actually brilliant.  So, less context switching, fewer regressions?
</Person2><Person1>Precisely! It's still early days, but tools like Cursor and this project called "Cursor Memory Bank" are making huge strides.
</Person1><Person2>Okay, I’m sold.  But how do we actually use this stuff at Settled?
</Person2><Person1>Well, we could integrate Firecore for data, experiment with task-driven development for TripFix features, and explore memory banks for larger projects.
</Person1><Person2>Let's do it!
</Person2><Person1>That's all for today's Goose Report, folks!  Keep honking, keep building, and keep those flights on time!</Person1>
